		<p>Here is a quote from IBM's website:</p>
		<blockquote cite="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/hybrid/value-calculator/?lnk=hpv18l3">
		Several leading financial services firms already use a hybrid cloud approach to meet the needs of a changing marketplace. 
		Leaders of such firms were surveyed to design a hypothetical scenario in which open standards are employed for innovation and portability, along with the use of multiple cloud platforms. 
		This hybrid, multi-cloud scenario demonstrated $250 million of yearly run-rate benefits for the hypothetical bank, and yielded a 2.5x increase in value compared to a public cloud-only approach.<sup>2</sup>
